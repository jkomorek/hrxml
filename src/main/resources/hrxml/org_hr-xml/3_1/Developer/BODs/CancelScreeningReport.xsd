       CancelScreeningReport conveys an instruction to cancel a previously communicated ScreeningReport instance. Cancel is not a simple delete in that cancelation may require business calculations and require prior agreement on cancelation terms. 

       ScreeningReport  Contains a set of data fulfilling or relating to an employment screening order. This may be detailed, fielded information, a link to a location where results can be accessed securely, or embedded or attached documents. 

       Cancel is an "Action Verb". ActionExpression(s) represent and communicate data management  
       instructions. The data entities being managed are represented as elements of the ScreeningReport noun in the BOD instance. 

       The Cancel verb is used when the sender of the BOD is not the owner of the 
       data, but is sending a request for the document to be canceled.
