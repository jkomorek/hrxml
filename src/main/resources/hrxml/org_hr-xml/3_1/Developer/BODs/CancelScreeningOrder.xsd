       CancelScreeningOrder conveys an instruction to cancel a previously communicated ScreeningOrder instance. Cancel is not a simple delete in that cancelation may require business calculations and require prior agreement on cancelation terms. 

       ScreeningOrder  Contains a set of information necessary to submit or administer screening requests to employment-screening service providers. Examples of screenings are searches of criminal records, education, employment, military service, professional licenses, professional sanctions, and credit. 

       Cancel is an "Action Verb". ActionExpression(s) represent and communicate data management  
       instructions. The data entities being managed are represented as elements of the ScreeningOrder noun in the BOD instance. 

       The Cancel verb is used when the sender of the BOD is not the owner of the 
       data, but is sending a request for the document to be canceled.
