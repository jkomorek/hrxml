			<xsd:documentation> 
       SyncScreeningPackageOrder is used when the owner of the data is passing or publishing that information or change in information to other software components. This is to be used when the receiver of the SyncScreeningPackageOrder does not own the data. This verb is commonly used when mass changes are necessary or when a publish and subscribe mechanism is used in the integration architecture. The purposes of this verb include application integrity and ease of data entry for the business user by enabling a single point of input. 

       ScreeningPackageOrder  This is a subset of the full ScreeningOrder. It is intended to support an &quot;OrderByPackageID&quot; scenario. As the name implies, the &quot;order by package&quot; pattern involves bundling all screening service options within predefined packages that are known to the customer and to the screening provider. This enables services to be ordered simply by referencing an associated &quot;PackageID.&quot; When using this pattern, details about specific screening services do not have to be communicated within the order. This simplifies order creation significantly and provides the opportunity to use an interoperable subset of the full ScreeningOrder noun.
