       Used to request a Change of a ScreeningCatalogReport previously communicated to the receiving application or party.  

       ScreeningCatalogReport contains a set of information describing a screening service provider's catalog. The catalog contains information about "packages", which consist of one or more individual screening services that are offered for sale as a unit. A catalog also may include detail about so-called "a la carte" screenings that can be ordered a part from a package. A catalog may represent services broadly offered for sale or may be catalogs specific to a particular customer or organizational unit. 

       Change is an "Action Verb". ActionExpression(s) represent and communicate data management  
       instructions.  Note that there are two implementation patterns: "Full Refresh" and "Delta." Under the 
       Full Refresh pattern, the type of data management instruction (action code: add, update, delete) is ommitted since a 
       full refresh of the noun or other defined scope is implied. Under the  Delta pattern, the action code would be specified 
       to be applied to the selected fields presented in the noun portion of the ChangeScreeningCatalogReport BOD. 
       Choice of implementation pattern is something agreed upon by trading partners.
