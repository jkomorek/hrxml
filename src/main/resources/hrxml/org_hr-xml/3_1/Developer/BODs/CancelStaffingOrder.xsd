       CancelStaffingOrder conveys an instruction to cancel a previously communicated StaffingOrder instance. Cancel is not a simple delete in that cancelation may require business calculations and require prior agreement on cancelation terms. 

       StaffingOrder  Contains a set of information sufficient to place and manage an order with a staffng supplier. Can also be used in &quot;request for quote&quot; (RFQ) operations underwhich a customer seeks pricing and offer information from a supplier in connection with a &quot;requisition.&quot;  A staffing requisition (a statement of staffing resource requirements) is a component of an order.  

       Cancel is an "Action Verb". ActionExpression(s) represent and communicate data management  
       instructions. The data entities being managed are represented as elements of the StaffingOrder noun in the BOD instance. 

       The Cancel verb is used when the sender of the BOD is not the owner of the 
       data, but is sending a request for the document to be canceled.
