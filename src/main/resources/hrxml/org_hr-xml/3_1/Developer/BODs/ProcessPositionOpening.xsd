       Status:  3.1 Release
       Date this version: 2010-Sep-21 
       Purpose: Used to request processing of the PositionOpening noun by a receiving application or party.  

       PositionOpening  Contains details about a position opening, including requirements for the position as well as administrative information, such as how to apply. 

       Process is an "Action Verb". ActionExpression(s) represent and communicate data management  
       instructions. XPath is the default expression language. The actionCode attribute (Add, Change, Delete,   
       Replace) specifies the action to be taken by the receiver. The data entities being managed   
       are represented as elements of the PositionOpening noun in the BOD instance.
