       Status:  3.1 Release
       Date this version: 2010-Sep-21 
       Purpose: CancelEPMResult conveys an instruction to cancel a previously communicated EPMResult instance or component thereof. Cancel is not a simple delete in that cancelation may require business calculations and require prior agreement on cancelation terms. 

       EPMResult  Defines a result from an employee performance management (EPM) process or &quot;appraisal&quot;. An appraisal typically consists of a number of sections, including an overall rating or score, competency ratings, objective ratings, and other ratings (e.g., &quot;core values&quot; is an example of a section within some appraisals outside of the competency or objectives section). Also includes result metadata, such as appraisal dates, &quot;prepared by,&quot; etc. Note that EPM is an HR-XML approved abbreviation for &quot;Employee Performance Management&quot;.

       EPMResult  Defines a result from an employee performance management (EPM) process or &quot;appraisal&quot;.

Also includes result metadata, such as appraisal dates, &quot;prepared by,&quot; etc. Note that EPM is an HR-XML approved abbreviation for &quot;Employee Performance Management&quot;. 

       Cancel is an "Action Verb". ActionExpression(s) represent and communicate data management  
       instructions. The data entities being managed are represented as elements of the EPMResult noun in the BOD instance. 

       The Cancel verb is used when the sender of the BOD is not the owner of the 
       data, but is sending a request for the document to be canceled.
