       Used to request a Change of a ObjectivesResult previously communicated to the receiving application or party.  

       ObjectivesResult  Contains information about results, against an objective plan (See ObjectivesPlan noun). Essentially, the same information can be communicated within EPMResult, which is a superset of information that can be reported within employee performance reports. ObjectivesResult is offered as a separate noun for integrations that may not involve the broad array of information available within EPMResult. 

       Change is an "Action Verb". ActionExpression(s) represent and communicate data management  
       instructions.  Note that there are two implementation patterns: "Full Refresh" and "Delta." Under the 
       Full Refresh pattern, the type of data management instruction (action code: add, update, delete) is ommitted since a 
       full refresh of the noun or other defined scope is implied. Under the  Delta pattern, the action code would be specified 
       to be applied to the selected fields presented in the noun portion of the ChangeObjectivesResult BOD. 
       Choice of implementation pattern is something agreed upon by trading partners.
