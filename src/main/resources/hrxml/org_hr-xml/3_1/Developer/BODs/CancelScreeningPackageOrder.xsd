       Name: CancelScreeningPackageOrder.xsd 
       Status:  3.1 Release
       Date this version: 2010-Sep-21 
       Purpose: CancelScreeningPackageOrder conveys an instruction to cancel a previously communicated ScreeningPackageOrder instance or component thereof. Cancel is not a simple delete in that cancelation may require business calculations and require prior agreement on cancelation terms. 

       ScreeningPackageOrder  This is a subset of the full ScreeningOrder. It is intended to support an &quot;OrderByPackageID&quot; scenario. As the name implies, the &quot;order by package&quot; pattern involves bundling all screening service options within predefined packages that are known to the customer and to the screening provider. This enables services to be ordered simply by referencing an associated &quot;PackageID.&quot; When using this pattern, details about specific screening services do not have to be communicated within the order. This simplifies order creation significantly and provides the opportunity to use an interoperable subset of the full ScreeningOrder noun.

       ScreeningPackageOrder  This is a subset of the full ScreeningOrder. It is intended to support an &quot;OrderByPackageID&quot; scenario. As the name implies, the &quot;order by package&quot; pattern involves bundling all screening service options within predefined packages that are known to the customer and to the screening provider.

This simplifies order creation significantly and provides the opportunity to use an interoperable subset of the full ScreeningOrder noun. 

       Cancel is an "Action Verb". ActionExpression(s) represent and communicate data management  
       instructions. The data entities being managed are represented as elements of the ScreeningPackageOrder noun in the BOD instance. 

       The Cancel verb is used when the sender of the BOD is not the owner of the 
       data, but is sending a request for the document to be canceled.
