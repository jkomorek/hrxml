       Used to request a Change of a IndicativeData previously communicated to the receiving application or party.  

       IndicativeData  Defines a set of data about the relationship between an employer and employee or former employee that is relevant to the provisioning of outsourced benefits and payroll systems. It is &quot;indicative&quot; data in that the target system has business rules and logic to administer the employee's compensation and/or benefits programs based on the data supplied. OED Indicative n. That points out, states, or declares; That indicates, points out, or directs; that hints or suggests; Furnishing indications of; suggestive of. 

       Change is an "Action Verb". ActionExpression(s) represent and communicate data management  
       instructions.  Note that there are two implementation patterns: "Full Refresh" and "Delta." Under the 
       Full Refresh pattern, the type of data management instruction (action code: add, update, delete) is ommitted since a 
       full refresh of the noun or other defined scope is implied. Under the  Delta pattern, the action code would be specified 
       to be applied to the selected fields presented in the noun portion of the ChangeIndicativeData BOD. 
       Choice of implementation pattern is something agreed upon by trading partners.
