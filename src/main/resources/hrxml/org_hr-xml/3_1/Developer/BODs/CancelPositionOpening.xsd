       CancelPositionOpening conveys an instruction to cancel a previously communicated PositionOpening instance. Cancel is not a simple delete in that cancelation may require business calculations and require prior agreement on cancelation terms. 

       PositionOpening  Contains details about a position opening, including requirements for the position as well as administrative information, such as how to apply. 

       Cancel is an "Action Verb". ActionExpression(s) represent and communicate data management  
       instructions. The data entities being managed are represented as elements of the PositionOpening noun in the BOD instance. 

       The Cancel verb is used when the sender of the BOD is not the owner of the 
       data, but is sending a request for the document to be canceled.
