       Status:  3.1 Release
       Date this version: 2010-Sep-21 
       Purpose: CancelStockOptionExerciseConfirmation conveys an instruction to cancel a previously communicated StockOptionExerciseConfirmation instance or component thereof.

The exact composition of the message varies depending on the type of program and the context, but information communicated in the confirmation may include: the number of shares exercised, the exercise price, fair market value (FMV) on the date of exercise, sales price (may differ from the FMV), taxes due/withheld, number of shares used to pay the taxes, and the amount of the taxable gain.

       CancelStockOptionExerciseConfirmation conveys an instruction to cancel a previously communicated StockOptionExerciseConfirmation instance. Cancel is not a simple delete in that cancelation may require business calculations and require prior agreement on cancelation terms. 

       StockOptionExerciseConfirmation  Contains information communicated from a broker to a stock option plan administrator regarding the exercise of stock options by a program participant.

       Cancel is an "Action Verb". ActionExpression(s) represent and communicate data management  
       instructions. The data entities being managed are represented as elements of the StockOptionExerciseConfirmation noun in the BOD instance. 

       The Cancel verb is used when the sender of the BOD is not the owner of the 
       data, but is sending a request for the document to be canceled.
