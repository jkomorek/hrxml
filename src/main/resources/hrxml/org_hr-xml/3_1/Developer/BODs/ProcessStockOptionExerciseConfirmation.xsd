       Name: ProcessStockOptionExerciseConfirmation.xsd 
       Status:  3.1 Release
       Date this version: 2010-Sep-21 
       Purpose: Used to request processing of the StockOptionExerciseConfirmation noun by a receiving application or party.  

       StockOptionExerciseConfirmation  Contains information communicated from a broker to a stock option plan administrator regarding the exercise of stock options by a program participant. The exact composition of the message varies depending on the type of program and the context, but information communicated in the confirmation may include: the number of shares exercised, the exercise price, fair market value (FMV) on the date of exercise, sales price (may differ from the FMV), taxes due/withheld, number of shares used to pay the taxes, and the amount of the taxable gain. 

       Process is an "Action Verb". ActionExpression(s) represent and communicate data management  
       instructions. XPath is the default expression language. The actionCode attribute (Add, Change, Delete,   
       Replace) specifies the action to be taken by the receiver. The data entities being managed   
       are represented as elements of the StockOptionExerciseConfirmation noun in the BOD instance.
