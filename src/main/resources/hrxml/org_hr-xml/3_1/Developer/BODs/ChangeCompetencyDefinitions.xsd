       Used to request a Change of a CompetencyDefinitions previously communicated to the receiving application or party.  

       CompetencyDefinitions  Contains structured information about the semantics associated with a one or more competencies. A Reusable Competency Definition (RCD) is reusable in that it is without a specific context. In other words, it is a definition of a competency not yet associated with a person profile, position, or learning object.   

       Change is an "Action Verb". ActionExpression(s) represent and communicate data management  
       instructions.  Note that there are two implementation patterns: "Full Refresh" and "Delta." Under the 
       Full Refresh pattern, the type of data management instruction (action code: add, update, delete) is ommitted since a 
       full refresh of the noun or other defined scope is implied. Under the  Delta pattern, the action code would be specified 
       to be applied to the selected fields presented in the noun portion of the ChangeCompetencyDefinitions BOD. 
       Choice of implementation pattern is something agreed upon by trading partners.
