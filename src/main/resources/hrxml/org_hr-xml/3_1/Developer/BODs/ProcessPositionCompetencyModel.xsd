       Name: ProcessPositionCompetencyModel.xsd 
       Status:  3.1 Release
       Date this version: 2010-Sep-21 
       Purpose: Used to request processing of the PositionCompetencyModel noun by a receiving application or party.  

       PositionCompetencyModel  Contains a collection of competency information associated with a position or job. A position competency model includes references to individual competencies and references to groups of competencies that are required or associated with a position or job. Within those groups and individual competency references is information about associated proficiency levels (require or desire proficiency), and weightings of the group or individual competencies among their siblings. 

       Process is an "Action Verb". ActionExpression(s) represent and communicate data management  
       instructions. XPath is the default expression language. The actionCode attribute (Add, Change, Delete,   
       Replace) specifies the action to be taken by the receiver. The data entities being managed   
       are represented as elements of the PositionCompetencyModel noun in the BOD instance.
