       SyncEmploymentEligibilityI-9 is used when the owner of the data is passing or publishing that information or change in information to other software components. This is to be used when the receiver of the SyncEmploymentEligibilityI-9 does not own the data. This verb is commonly used when mass changes are necessary or when a publish and subscribe mechanism is used in the integration architecture. The purposes of this verb include application integrity and ease of data entry for the business user by enabling a single point of input. 

        EmploymentEligibilityI-9 contains a set of information describing a screening service provider's catalog. The catalog contains information about "packages", which consist of one or more individual screening services that are offered for sale as a unit. A catalog also may include detail about so-called "a la carte" screenings that can be ordered a part from a package. A catalog may represent services broadly offered for sale or may be catalogs specific to a particular customer or organizational unit.
