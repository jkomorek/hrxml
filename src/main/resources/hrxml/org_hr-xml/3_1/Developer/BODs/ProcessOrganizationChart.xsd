       Name: ProcessOrganizationChart.xsd 
       Status:  3.1 Release
       Date this version: 2010-Sep-21 
       Purpose: Used to request processing of the OrganizationChart noun by a receiving application or party.  

       OrganizationChart  Provides a simple, &quot;open model&quot; structure for communicating basic information about an organization, its sub-entities or &quot;organization units,&quot; the positions within those units, and the incumbents within those positions. The schema design is &quot;flat&quot; versus recursive in design, but hierarchy and reporting relationships can be expressed. 

       Process is an "Action Verb". ActionExpression(s) represent and communicate data management  
       instructions. XPath is the default expression language. The actionCode attribute (Add, Change, Delete,   
       Replace) specifies the action to be taken by the receiver. The data entities being managed   
       are represented as elements of the OrganizationChart noun in the BOD instance.
