       Used to request processing of the EmploymentEligibilityI-9 noun by a receiving application or party.  

       EmploymentEligibilityI-9 contains a set of information describing a screening service provider's catalog. The catalog contains information about "packages", which consist of one or more individual screening services that are offered for sale as a unit. A catalog also may include detail about so-called "a la carte" screenings that can be ordered a part from a package. A catalog may represent services broadly offered for sale or may be catalogs specific to a particular customer or organizational unit. 

       Process is an "Action Verb". ActionExpression(s) represent and communicate data management  
       instructions. XPath is the default expression language. The actionCode attribute (Add, Change, Delete,   
       Replace) specifies the action to be taken by the receiver. The data entities being managed   
       are represented as elements of the EmploymentEligibilityI-9 noun in the BOD instance.
