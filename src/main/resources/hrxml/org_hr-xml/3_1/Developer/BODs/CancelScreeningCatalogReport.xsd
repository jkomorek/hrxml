       CancelScreeningCatalogReport conveys an instruction to cancel a previously communicated ScreeningCatalogReport instance. Cancel is not a simple delete in that cancelation may require business calculations and require prior agreement on cancelation terms. 

       ScreeningCatalogReport contains a set of information describing a screening service provider's catalog. The catalog contains information about "packages", which consist of one or more individual screening services that are offered for sale as a unit. A catalog also may include detail about so-called "a la carte" screenings that can be ordered a part from a package. A catalog may represent services broadly offered for sale or may be catalogs specific to a particular customer or organizational unit. 
       
       Cancel is an "Action Verb". ActionExpression(s) represent and communicate data management  
       instructions. The data entities being managed are represented as elements of the ScreeningCatalogReport noun in the BOD instance. 

       The Cancel verb is used when the sender of the BOD is not the owner of the 
       data, but is sending a request for the document to be canceled.
