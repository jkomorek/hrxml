       NotifyEmploymentEligibilityI-9 is used to inform the receiving party that an event related to a EmploymentEligibilityI-9 has occurred or 
       a EmploymentEligibilityI-9 has been created or modified. 

       EmploymentEligibilityI-9 contains a set of information describing a screening service provider's catalog. The catalog contains information about "packages", which consist of one or more individual screening services that are offered for sale as a unit. A catalog also may include detail about so-called "a la carte" screenings that can be ordered a part from a package. A catalog may represent services broadly offered for sale or may be catalogs specific to a particular customer or organizational unit. 

       Notify is a "Action Verb". ActionExpression(s) represent and communicate data management  
       instructions. XPath is the default expression language. The actionCode attribute (Add, Change, Delete,   
       Replace) specifies the action taken. The data entities being managed are represented as elements  
       of the EmploymentEligibilityI-9 noun in the BOD instance.
