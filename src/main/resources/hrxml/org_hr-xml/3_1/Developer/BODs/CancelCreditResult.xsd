       CancelCreditResult conveys an instruction to cancel a previously communicated CreditResult instance. Cancel is not a simple delete in that cancelation may require business calculations and require prior agreement on cancelation terms. 

       CreditResult  Contains information returned from a search from one or more consumer reporting or &quot;credit bureaus.&quot; May be information sourced from a single bureau or possibly a report of &quot;merged&quot; results from several bureaus. 

       Cancel is an "Action Verb". ActionExpression(s) represent and communicate data management  
       instructions. The data entities being managed are represented as elements of the CreditResult noun in the BOD instance. 

       The Cancel verb is used when the sender of the BOD is not the owner of the 
       data, but is sending a request for the document to be canceled.
