       Status:  3.1 Release
       Date this version: 2010-Sep-21 
       Purpose: CancelEPMRaterPanel conveys an instruction to cancel a previously communicated EPMRaterPanel instance or component thereof. Cancel is not a simple delete in that cancelation may require business calculations and require prior agreement on cancelation terms. 

       EPMRaterPanel  Contains a collection of information about individuals that are designated to serve as evaluators or &quot;raters&quot; within performance appraisal processes. Also see EPMParticipant, which is a possible alternative.

       CancelEPMRaterPanel conveys an instruction to cancel a previously communicated EPMRaterPanel instance. Cancel is not a simple delete in that cancelation may require business calculations and require prior agreement on cancelation terms. 

       EPMRaterPanel  Contains a collection of information about individuals that are designated to serve as evaluators or &quot;raters&quot; within performance appraisal processes. Also see EPMParticipant, which is a possible alternative. 

       Cancel is an "Action Verb". ActionExpression(s) represent and communicate data management  
       instructions. The data entities being managed are represented as elements of the EPMRaterPanel noun in the BOD instance. 

       The Cancel verb is used when the sender of the BOD is not the owner of the 
       data, but is sending a request for the document to be canceled.
