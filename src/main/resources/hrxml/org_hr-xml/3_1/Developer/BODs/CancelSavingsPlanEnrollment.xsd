       SavingsPlanEnrollment  Intended to support the communication of enrollment and election information for savings and defined contribution plans, such a 401(k) plans within the U.S. market. 

       Cancel is an "Action Verb". ActionExpression(s) represent and communicate data management  
       instructions. The data entities being managed are represented as elements of the SavingsPlanEnrollment noun in the BOD instance.

       data, but is sending a request for the document to be canceled.
