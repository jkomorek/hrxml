       Name: ProcessEPMResult.xsd 
       Status:  3.1 Release
       Date this version: 2010-Sep-21 
       Purpose: Used to request processing of the EPMResult noun by a receiving application or party.  

       EPMResult  Defines a result from an employee performance management (EPM) process or &quot;appraisal&quot;. An appraisal typically consists of a number of sections, including an overall rating or score, competency ratings, objective ratings, and other ratings (e.g., &quot;core values&quot; is an example of a section within some appraisals outside of the competency or objectives section). Also includes result metadata, such as appraisal dates, &quot;prepared by,&quot; etc. Note that EPM is an HR-XML approved abbreviation for &quot;Employee Performance Management&quot;. 

       Process is an "Action Verb". ActionExpression(s) represent and communicate data management  
       instructions. XPath is the default expression language. The actionCode attribute (Add, Change, Delete,   
       Replace) specifies the action to be taken by the receiver. The data entities being managed   
       are represented as elements of the EPMResult noun in the BOD instance.
