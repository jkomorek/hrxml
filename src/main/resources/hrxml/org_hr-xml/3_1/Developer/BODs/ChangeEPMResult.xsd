       Used to request a Change of a EPMResult previously communicated to the receiving application or party.  

       EPMResult  Defines a result from an employee performance management (EPM) process or &quot;appraisal&quot;. An appraisal typically consists of a number of sections, including an overall rating or score, competency ratings, objective ratings, and other ratings (e.g., &quot;core values&quot; is an example of a section within some appraisals outside of the competency or objectives section). Also includes result metadata, such as appraisal dates, &quot;prepared by,&quot; etc. Note that EPM is an HR-XML approved abbreviation for &quot;Employee Performance Management&quot;. 

       Change is an "Action Verb". ActionExpression(s) represent and communicate data management  
       instructions.  Note that there are two implementation patterns: "Full Refresh" and "Delta." Under the 
       Full Refresh pattern, the type of data management instruction (action code: add, update, delete) is ommitted since a 
       full refresh of the noun or other defined scope is implied. Under the  Delta pattern, the action code would be specified 
       to be applied to the selected fields presented in the noun portion of the ChangeEPMResult BOD. 
       Choice of implementation pattern is something agreed upon by trading partners.
